    <h1>Lemony Chicken and Orzo Soup</h1>
    <img src="../img/Basically-Lemony-Chicken-Orzo-Soup.webp" alt="Lemon Chicken Orzo Soup!">
    <h3>A light bright soup that reminds one of warmer days. This dish
        is still rich enough to stick to your ribs while providing 
        some refreshment anytime of day. I branch from the original
        recipe to add some much needed flavor and savory qualities
        that are quite simple. Browning the chicken and orzo then deglazing the
        pan, adding additional aromatics, and livening the soup with
        aleppo pepper flakes and fish sauce.

    <ol>
        <li>Throughly season chicken on all sides. 
            Heat oil in a dutch oven over medium high heat. Brown
            chicken skin until a deep sear is achieved, 5 to 7 minutes.
            Remove from pot.
        </li>
        <li>Adding oil if necessary, saute leek and celery until soft,
            5 to 8 minutes. Add chili flakes and garlic and saute until
            fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring constantly. Return 
            chicken to pot and add broth. Bring to a boil and reduce to
            a simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
            Remove chicken and shred when cool.
        </li>
        <li>Return the broth to a boil and cook orzo until al dente, 
            8-10 minutes.
        </li>

            and fish sauce. Serve with lemon wedges, extra dill, and
